# Connected Components Example with Docker Compose

This example is intended as a follow-up after completion of the [Java SDK Showcase Tutorial](../showcase). If you're
already familiar with the Java SDK fundamentals and would like to get a better understanding of how a realistic StateFun
application looks like, then you're in the right place! Otherwise, we highly suggest taking a look at the Showcase
tutorial first.

This example works with Docker Compose, and runs a few services that build up an end-to-end StateFun application:
- Functions service that runs your functions and expose them through an HTTP endpoint.
- StateFun runtime processes (a manager plus workers) that will handle ingress, egress, and inter-function messages as
  well as function state storage in a consistent and fault-tolerant manner.
- Apache Kafka broker for the application ingress and egress. StateFun currently natively supports AWS Kinesis as well,
  and you can also extend to connect with other systems.

To motivate this example, we'll implement a [connected components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_(graph_theory) algorithm on top of Stateful Functions.
The program has one function - a `ConnectedComponentsFn` that consumes `Vertex` JSON events from an ingress and communicates with its neighbours to find the minimal component id.
Changes of the component id of a vertex are being output via an egress.

## Directory structure

- `src/`, `pom.xml` and `Dockerfile`: These files and directories are the contents of a Java Maven project which builds
  our functions service, hosting the `ConnectedComponentsFn` behind a HTTP endpoint. Check out the source code under
  `src/main/java`. The `Dockerfile` is used to build a Docker image for our functions service.
- `vertices.txt`: A file with multiple JSON objects per line; this is used as test events produced to our application ingress.
- `module.yaml`: The [Module Specification](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-statefun-docs-release-3.0/docs/deployment/module/) file to be mounted to the StateFun runtime process containers. This
  configures a few things for a StateFun application, such as the service endpoints of the application's functions, as
  well as definitions of [Ingresses and Egresses](https://ci.apache.org/projects/flink/flink-statefun-docs-release-3.0/docs/io-module/overview/) which the application will use.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose file to spin up everything.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Running the example

First, lets build the example. From this directory, execute:

```
$ docker-compose build
```

This pulls all the necessary Docker images (StateFun and Kafka), and also builds the functions service image. This can
take a few minutes as it also needs to build the function's Java project.

Afterward the build completes, start running all the services:

```
$ docker-compose up
```

## Play around!

You can take a look at what messages are being sent to the Kafka egress:

```
$ docker-compose exec kafka rpk topic consume connected-component-changes
```

You can also try modifying the function code in the `src/main/java` directory, and do a zero-downtime upgrade of the
functions. Some ideas you can try out:
- Enable the connected component computation for graphs with undirected edges
- Make the neighbour set changeable

After you've finished changing the function code, you can do a hot redeploy of your functions service:

```
$ docker-compose up -d --build connected-components-functions
```

This rebuilds the functions service image with the updated code, and restarts the service with the new image.
